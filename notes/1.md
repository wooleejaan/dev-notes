## Understanding the Event Loop in Chrome Web Browser

##### Browser Processes and Threads

Browsers operate through processes and threads, much like how applications run programs and execute tasks. Each Chrome browser window spawns its own browser process (or browser engine). Within that process, each tab runs in its own renderer process (or rendering engine).

The browser process handles everything outside of the tabs, while each renderer process manages the contents within its respective tab.
The JavaScript engine is embedded within each renderer process.

To illustrate with an example, when you type something into the address bar, the browser process evaluates it first. If it's a search query, it passes it to the search engine; if it's a URL, it uses the network thread within the browser process to request the resource. Once deemed safe, the browser process hands off the data to the renderer process for that tab to render the web page (known as the rendering process or Rendering Critical Path).

##### How the Browser Event Loop Operates

When the browser process identifies the user input as a URL, it requests the corresponding IP address from the DNS server via the network thread. It checks the cached DNS records first; if not found, it requests the IP address from the DNS server, a process known as Recursive Query. This recursive search continues until the IP address for the domain is found.

With the IP address in hand, the browser process requests the HTML document from the web server. The HTTP request is sent through the TCP/IP protocol stack, following the path of HTTP → TCP → IP → Ethernet. The request is then encapsulated in an Ethernet frame and transmitted to the server. Upon reaching the server, the frame is decapsulated back into Ethernet → IP → TCP → HTTP and sent to the web server program. A TCP 3-Way Handshake establishes the connection between the client and server, allowing for complete request and response exchanges.

If HTTPS is used, an SSL protocol layer is added before the HTTP request. After a complete request/response cycle, the cache lifecycle is determined by the response header’s Cache-Control directive.

Upon receiving the complete request, the web server may interact with a WAS (Web Application Server) for dynamic content or database operations. The WAS processes the request and returns the result to the web server, which then sends the HTML document back to the browser. The browser hands the HTML file to the renderer process, where the main thread starts the rendering process.

The main thread first parses the HTML into a DOM Tree, halting at blocking resources like `<link>` tags or non-async/non-defer `<script>` tags. CSS files are also considered blocking to prevent Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC). The parser may use a preload scanner to handle requests in parallel, improving performance.

The main thread constructs the DOM Tree, creates the CSSOM Tree, and then builds the Render Tree. The rendering steps involve Layout, Paint, and Compositing, summarized as Parsing → Style → Layout → Paint → Composite.

- Layout: Calculates the exact position and size of nodes in the Render Tree.
- Paint: Draws the layout on the screen, dividing it into layers.
- Reflow & Repaint: Recalculates and redraws elements when changes occur.
- Composition: Combines layers according to their z-index, optimizing re-rendering to enhance speed.

When encountering a `<script>` tag, parsing stops, and control is handed over to the JavaScript engine within the renderer process, introducing the concept of the event loop. The event loop monitors the JavaScript engine's call stack and various queues, transferring tasks from queues to the call stack when it’s empty. This model ensures JavaScript’s concurrency.

The main thread runs JavaScript code through the JS engine, which has a memory heap and a call stack. The call stack operates on a single-threaded basis, processing one task at a time.

Web APIs are designed to run outside the JS engine, managed by the event loop, which transfers these APIs back to the browser for execution. Once executed, they are placed in a queue and picked up by the event loop when the call stack is clear, ensuring precise execution timing.

The event loop in JavaScript runtime includes:

- Task Queue (or Macrotask Queue, Event Queue, Callback Queue): Stores asynchronous callbacks like setTimeout.
- Microtask Queue (or Job Queue): Stores asynchronous callbacks from Promises, async/await, process.nextTick, object.observe, MutationObserver, and ensures quick processing at the end of each cycle.
- Animation Frames (or Render Queue): Holds requestAnimationFrame callbacks for rendering tasks.

## 인증과 인가

로그인은 회원가입이 선행되어야 함.<br>
브라우저 => 서버로 로그인 요청(id/pw) => 서버가 db에서 찾아보고 해당 정보 존재 확인

- 백엔드 서버 메모리(변수, session이라고 부름)에 저장해둠. => 로그인 uuid(세션id == 토큰id)와 로그인된 이메일 저장 (이 과정을 `인증Authentication`이라고 함)
- 세션id를 브라우저에 전달해줌. 이걸 브라우저는 일반적으로 브라우저 저장공간(변수 말고)에 저장해둠.
- 이후 유저 정보 받아오는 fetchUser 보낼 때, 브라우저에 저장해둔 세션id를 함께 서버에 전달. (이 과정을 `인가Authorization`이라고 함)
- 백엔드 메모리(세션)에 저장해둔 정보와 일치하면 확인.

문제점(사용자 접속량 많아지면 서버 컴퓨터 메모리 용량 부족) => 해결방법 2가지

- 컴퓨터 사양 높이기 (스케일업)
- 컴퓨터 사양을 높이는 대신, 백엔드 컴퓨터 여러 대 배치. (스케일아웃) => 각각 컴퓨터에서 동일한 소스코드 복사해서 yarn start ...

스케일아웃의 문제점(유저가 서버컴퓨터1에서 인증했는데, 서버컴퓨터2에서 인가하려면? => 결과적으로 메모리 세션도 모든 컴퓨터마다 존재해야 함)

- 메모리(세션)을 백엔드 컴퓨터에 두지 말고, db의 세션 테이블에 두는 방식으로 변경 (세션 테이블)
- 백엔드 컴퓨터가 메모리를 운영한다는 것 == 상태 관리 == stateful
- 메모리를 db로 옮기고, 백엔드 서버가 stateless가 되면 스케일아웃을 할 수 있음.

위 해결 방법의 문제점 (트래픽이 결국에는 db로 몰림. 병목현상은 동일) => db를 쪼개는 방법 (파티셔닝 기법)

- 수직 파티셔닝 (좌우로 쪼개는 것 => `정규화`와 무슨 차이? => 정규화는 의미 기준으로 쪼개는 반면, 파티셔닝은 같은 의미더라도 개수가 많으면 쪼갠다. 자주 쓰이는 상태 위주로 쪼갬.)
- 수평 파티셔닝 (수평으로 쪼개되, 쪼개서 다른 db에 저장하는 건 `샤딩`이라고 함)

쪼갠다는 것은? => 서버로 들어온 유저 요청 확인 후, 1-1000이면 db1로 보내고 1001-2000이면 db2로 보내고...<br>
db에서 데이터를 조회한다는 것은? => 하드디스크에서 파일을 찾는 것과 같음.

- ram과 달리, disk에서 찾는 건 느림. cpu/ram/disk로 생각해보면 쉬움.
- 즉, `Disk I/O`가 많아짐. 디스크 조회하고 받아오는 게 많아져서 느려지므로 또 하나의 문제가 됨.

Disk I/O를 어떻게 줄이지? => db 중에서도 disk i/o에 저장 안 하는 방법으로 우회 (`Redis라는 db에 저장 (mysql이 아닌)`)

- Redis는 데이터를 저장하되, `디스크`에 저장하지 않고 `메모리`에 저장함
  - 속도가 빠름. 대신 영구저장 아님(영구저장 옵션은 존재)

=> 세션 테이블을 Redis에 넣는 방식으로 발전하게 됨 (성능 개선)

- 인가를 하기 위해, redis에서 토큰id(세션id) 일치하는지 확인 -> 그다음 db에서 유저 정보 가져오는 프로세스.

또 하나의 문제 => 매 api 요청마다 redis를 가야하면 (쿼리가 2번씩 발생)

=> redis가 아닌 jwt 토큰 방식으로 변경

인증을 위해서 db는 무조건 가야함 (user 테이블의 실제 정보와 비교해야 하므로)

- db에서 확인한 후 => 서버컴퓨터 메모리나 db 테이블에 저장하지 않고, 이메일 같은 정보를 임의의 id로 만듦.
- 만드는 방법? => 객체 만들고, 객체를 변수에 담고 암호화(이후 복호화 가능) => 암호화된 결과를 세션 토큰으로 사용 (세션 토큰을 브라우저에 전달 => 브라우저는 세션 토큰을 쿠키에 저장)
- 브라우저는 매 요청마다 세션 토큰을 서버로 전달 => 서버는 이제 더 이상 redis로 가서 확인하는 과정을 거치지 않고, 그 자리에서 바로 복호화 => 똑같은 결과가 나오면 redis에 가지 않아도 유저 정보 일치한다는 것을 확인 (인가를 위해 쿼리 2번 날릴 필요 없음)
- 여기에서 사용한 토큰이 jwt(Json Web Token) => JSON(JavaScript Object Notation)

---

## JWT // 쿠키와 다른 브라우저 스토리지 차이 // nestjs 인증+인가

https://jwt.io/

encode(암호화), decode(복호화)

페이로드가 핵심. (헤더에는 알고리즘 담겨 있음, 시그니처는 비밀번호임)<br>

jwt를 용도에 따라 구분 (AccessToken, RefreshToken)

jwt는 다른 암호화 방식과 차이 존재.

- jwt 내부 정보는 쉽게 확인할 수 있으므로, 중요한 데이터는 넣으면 안 됨
- => 암호화의 의미는? 조작 가능성?
- => jwt는 누구든지 볼 수 있지만, 대신 수정하려면 비밀번호가 필요함(수정이 어려움)
- => 백엔드에서 하는 게 이게 조작된 jwt인지 검증하는 과정

브라우저 로컬스토리지는 껐다 켜도 유지, 브라우저 세션스토리지는 껐다 키면 사라짐<br>
=> 쿠키도 껐다 키면 유지 => 쿠키는 뭐가 다른지? (로컬, 세션스토리지와 달리 쿠키는 백엔드와 연관 => 백엔드와 주고 받는 데이터는 쿠키에 보통 저장/관리)

쿠키는 보완 관련 옵션 많음. + 쿠키는 브라우저에만 저장되지 않음. (api 쏠 때 쿠키에 저장된 것들 자동 전달)<br>
=> 프론트에서 저장할 수 있는 경우의 수 (크게 4가지 => 변수, 로컬스토리지, 세션스토리지, 쿠키)

## How to Safely Use Values and Reduce Unnecessary Type Creation

"Const assertions" are a special type of notation in TypeScript.

By using `as const`, you tell TypeScript to fix the value as a literal type. This informs the compiler that the properties of the variable or object won't change, enabling stricter type checking.

Const assertions can only be used with literal values. When applied to strings and numbers, they narrow the type, which helps to avoid unnecessary type creation.

```ts
type Color = "red" | "green" | "blue";
type Variant = "light" | "dark";

// There's no need to create a type like `ColorVariant = `${Variant}-${Color}`
function createColorVariant(color: Color, variant: Variant) {
  return `${variant}-${color}` as const;
}
```

When you use `as const` with an object, it makes all properties read-only and narrows their types. When used with an array, it turns the array into a read-only tuple with narrowed types.

- A tuple essentially means an ordered array of values.

##### Using Const Assertions

```ts
type ColorType = "red" | "blue" | "green";

interface ColorInterface {
  id: string;
  type: ColorType;
}

interface Red extends ColorInterface {
  type: "red";
  // ...
}
```

When extending types based on a discriminated union like the `ColorType` above, the code's meaning can become unclear. For example, understanding that the `type` in the `Red` interface must be one of the `ColorType` values can require unnecessary digging.

Const assertions can make this code clearer and safer.

```ts
const COLOR_TYPE = {
  RED: "red",
  BLUE: "blue",
  GREEN: "green",
} as const;

type ColorType = (typeof COLOR_TYPE)[keyof typeof COLOR_TYPE];

interface ColorInterface {
  id: string;
  type: ColorType;
}

interface Red extends ColorInterface {
  type: typeof COLOR_TYPE; // More intuitive and safer than just writing 'red'

  // ...
}
```

## Converting TypeScript Files to JavaScript Files

The TypeScript compiler (tsc) begins by reading the tsconfig.json file to determine the project's compile options and the list of files to be included in the compilation (configured through exclude, include, files, etc.).

In the Pre-process Files stage, tsc constructs a dependency graph of all ts files based on import and export statements. This step determines the actual list of files to be compiled.

During the Tokenize and Parse stage, the source code is broken down into its smallest units, called tokens, and an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is created from these tokens. This stage also includes an initial check for syntax errors.

- The scanner converts code strings into tokens, and the parser uses these tokens to build the AST.

In the Binding stage, tsc's [binder](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/main/src/compiler/binder.ts) generates Symbols (for variables, functions, classes, etc.) for each node in the AST, establishing Scope and Symbol information.

- This stage involves converting identifiers to symbols.
- During data collection, flow containers are created based on flow conditions, storing node types.

In the Type Checking stage, tsc's [checker](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/main/src/compiler/checker.ts) uses the Symbols and AST to perform type checks.

In the Emitting stage, tsc's [emitter](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/blob/main/src/compiler/emitter.ts) generates the final JavaScript code based on the AST. The .ts files are converted to .js files according to the JavaScript version specified in tsconfig.json.

## Hydration (or re-hydration)

Hydration (or re-hydration) is the process of attaching JavaScript event handlers to static HTML elements rendered by the server, transforming them into an interactive web page. Initially, the server sends the HTML to the client, and then the JavaScript bundle is loaded to bind each DOM node.

Hydration directly affects the time it takes for the page to become interactive after the initial render, significantly impacting the user experience. Therefore, improving hydration performance can speed up the delivery of initial content and the time to interactive (TTI).

##### Various Technical Approaches to Improve Hydration Performance

To swiftly deliver web pages to users, several technical strategies (or ideas) can be employed:

- **Streaming Server-Side Rendering**: This involves sending server-rendered HTML to the client in small chunks and progressively rendering it on the client side. This can enhance the initial render speed.

- **Progressive Hydration**: Assign priorities during the hydration process based on importance, delaying the hydration of lower-priority parts to shorten the TTI.

- **Partial Hydration**: An extension of Progressive Hydration, where only specific areas are hydrated. Examples include 'Island Architecture' and 'React Server Components'.
  ![alt text](/images/hydration.png)

- **Trisomorphic Rendering**: Using a Service Worker to share templates or routing code between the server, client, and Service Worker, implementing Streaming Server-Side Rendering within the Service Worker.

## The concept of Islands

The concept of Islands is deceptively simple: render HTML on the server, and inject placeholders or slots for interactive widgets that can then be "hydrated" on the client. This allows for reusing the server-rendered initial HTML.

This technique is also known as partial or selective hydration.

Traditional JavaScript frameworks lack the ability to selectively and strategically hydrate components. The Islands Architecture in Astro provides this capability out-of-the-box, using what’s known as the component islands pattern.

In Astro, an island refers to an interactive UI component.

##### Benefits of Islands

- `Performance`: The majority of your website is converted to fast, static HTML, and JavaScript is only loaded when necessary. Since JavaScript is one of the slowest assets to load per byte, every byte matters.
- `Parallel Loading`: Prioritizing what users see is crucial. Astro excels in this area, allowing you to easily configure when each component should be rendered, using <a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#client-directives" target="_blank">client directives</a>

## Why Sorting in Dynamic Languages is Challenging

In dynamic languages like JavaScript, comparison operations can be quite heavy. This is primarily because the comparison function can be arbitrarily defined by the user, leading to inconsistent behavior.

```js
const array = [4, 2, 5, 3, 1];

function compare(a, b) {
  // Arbitrary code goes here, e.g. `array.push(1);`.
  return a - b;
}

// A “typical” sort call.
array.sort(compare);
```

##### In the V8 Engine

When sorting elements, V8 goes through a three-step process, including pre-processing and post-processing steps.

1. Before actual sorting, it gathers all non-undefined elements into a temporary list and sorts them. The comparison function is used only in this step.
2. It handles undefined elements separately. Since all elements are undefined, no actual sorting is needed—only the length is calculated.
3. Once sorting is complete, the values are written back to the original array or object.

##### Sorting Algorithms: Past and Present

Array.prototype.sort used to rely on Quick Sort, but now it uses Tim Sort.

- Quick Sort's performance heavily depends on pivot selection, due to the principle of locality of reference.

Tim Sort is a modified version of Merge Sort and is generally more efficient.

- While Merge Sort operates recursively, Tim Sort works iteratively (minrun ~ merge ~ galloping ...).
- The transition from Quick Sort to Tim Sort involves using a temporary array for merging. This temporary array is quickly allocated and deallocated in V8's new space, making it short-lived.

##### More on Comparison Sorting Algorithms

There are many sorting algorithms. Based on average time complexity, Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort are `O(n^2)`, while Heap Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort are `O(n log n)`.

Time complexity is influenced by the principle of locality of reference. Even with the same `O(n log n)` complexity, performance can vary due to the constant factor C in `C * n log n + α`.

- Heap Sort has poor locality of reference. The range of indices it compares is broad, making it hard to predict for cache memory.
- Merge Sort has good locality of reference since it compares and merges adjacent sections, but it requires additional memory proportional to the input array size.
- Quick Sort generally has good locality of reference around the pivot. However, in the worst case, it can degrade to `O(n^2)`.

## Writing Code That's Easy to Compile

```ts
import React from "react";

type ButtonProps = React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement> & {
  extraProp: string;
};
```

```ts
import React from "react";

interface ButtonProps extends React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLButtonElement> {
  extraProp: string;
}
```

TypeScript and its compiler (tsc) are known for their performance, but there's a noticeable difference in compile times between these two code snippets. Using `interface extends` is slightly faster than using `&` for intersections. This doesn't mean that `interface` is faster than `type` in general, but in this specific context, it holds true.

Here are some reasons why:

- **Flat Object Type Creation**: `interface` creates a single flat object type and detects property conflicts, whereas intersection types recursively merge properties, potentially creating unnecessary types.
- **Consistency**: Interfaces have a long-standing presence in programming due to their consistency and reliability. They are particularly powerful when writing extensible, object-oriented code. Intersections, on the other hand, can be less predictable.
- **Caching**: Interfaces benefit from being cached in type relations, whereas intersection types are not cached and are checked thoroughly each time.

There are additional practices for writing compiler-friendly code:

- **Type Annotations**: Adding type annotations can significantly reduce the work the compiler has to do in type inference.
- **Base Types for Unions**: Using base types for union types can improve performance.

##### When Not to Optimize for Compiler Ease

While intersections can be less compiler-friendly, they are effective for precisely describing complex type relationships. When you need to express intricate type combinations accurately, intersections are a powerful tool.

## Zod쓰는 이유 // 프론트 안정성 높이기 (zod + sentry api)

Zod is a powerful data validation and type inference library for TypeScript environments.

##### Trust: Enhancing Input Reliability with Zod

In JavaScript applications, you deal with various inputs and outputs, which inherently involve a sort of contract. However, JavaScript lacks built-in enforcement of these contracts.

TypeScript addresses this partially by providing static type checking, but it doesn't guarantee type safety at runtime. Traditionally, developers have tackled this issue by using separate runtime validation libraries alongside TypeScript, leading to potential code duplication.

Zod solves this problem with Zod Schema. It allows you to define TypeScript types and simultaneously handle runtime data validation using a single schema.

For example, defining a schema with Zod lets you manage both TypeScript types and runtime validation seamlessly:

```ts
import { z } from "zod";

// Zod schema
const colorSchema = z.object({
  color: z.string(),
  background: z.array(z.string()),
});

// TypeScript type
export type IColor = z.infer<typeof colorSchema>;

// Create some color
const redColor: IColor = {
  color: "red",
  background: ["white", "black"],
};

// Run-time validation
console.log(colorSchema.parse(redColor));
```

##### Control: Robust Error Handling with Zod

Zod shines in its ability to detect and handle errors when data doesn't conform to the schema. It goes beyond simple error throwing, offering customizable error messages and additional handling mechanisms.

```ts
const schema = z.schema({
  name: z.string().min(3, { message: "이름은 최소 3자 이상이어야 합니다." }),
  age: z.number().max(120, { message: "나이는 120세를 넘을 수 없습니다." }),
  email: z.string().email({ message: "유효한 이메일 주소가 아닙니다." }),
});
```

Here's another example illustrating Zod's error handling:

```ts
const schema = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  age: z.number(),
});

const data = {
  name: "John",
  age: "30", // age should be a number, but it's a string here
};

const parsedData = schema.safeParse(data);

if (parsedData.success) {
  console.log(parsedData.data); // { name: 'John', age: 30 }
} else {
  console.log("Data is invalid"); // This will be executed because age is not a number
}
```

Zod also handles asynchronous data validation seamlessly:

```ts
const schema = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  age: z.number(),
});

async function getData() {
  const data = await fetchData(); // Assume this fetches data asynchronously
  const parsedData = await schema.safeParseAsync(data);

  if (parsedData.success) {
    console.log(parsedData.data); // { name: 'John', age: 30 }
  } else {
    console.log("Data is invalid");
  }
}
```
